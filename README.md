# AireParaguay


Hi there! Welcome to the GitHub Page of the AireParaguay Android Application! 

My name is Adit Shetty, and I am a rising senior in high school. I would like to thank Dr. Kerekes of RIT for picking up my phone call many weeks ago when I inquired about a possible internship. Not only was Dr. Kerekes understanding, he took some time to connect me to Mr. Guillermo Pallarolas, an electrical engineer from Paraguay. Mr. Pallarolas is a great engineer and is extremely knowledgable about sensors and is the creator of AireParaguay. 

AireParaguay is Mr. Pallarolas's project which aims to provide clear information to the citizens of Paraguay about the air quality within the country. The sensors Mr. Pallarolas is using for AireParaguay are the SPS30 brand, which is a Particulate Matter Sensor. It uses laser technology to measure PM2.5 data, a dangerous type of particulate matter that, if present in great amounts, can be lethal to one's health (due to it's extremely small size). Thus, Mr. Pallarolas's project is critical to informing the general public of Paraguay of the air quality in their country. 

The data analysis of the sensor data is a bit complicated, so if you would like to know more,  check out the AireParaguay website or contact Mr. Pallarolas. It involves Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), and an Amazon web service that is hosting a Linux server with Node.js. 

I'm the app developer for the Android interface of aireparaguay.org. It was a super fun experience to not just develop this Android app, but to learn more about sensors and enviromental awareness and sustainability. I am also super happy to have made it easier for Paraguay residents to get information about air quality. 

I would also like to thank the countless tutorials I used online, including those from Coding in Flow, Coding with Mitch, Philipp Lackner, and other tutorials and Stack Overflow threads to help me throughout this project.

Once again, thank you so much to Dr. Kerekes and Mr. Pallarolas for giving me this outstanding opportunity!
